# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture important architectural and technical decisions made while developing a system, along with their context and consequences.

## Why Use ADRs?

- Document the rationale behind key decisions
- Improve team communication and onboarding
- Track changes and alternatives over time
- Support compliance and audits

## ADR Template

``` text
# [Title]

## Status
Accepted / Proposed / Deprecated / Superseded

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were considered and why were they not chosen?
```

## Example ADR

``` text
# Use Clean Architecture for Core Business Logic

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a scalable, testable, and maintainable architecture for a multi-platform app. The team has experience with Clean Architecture and it fits our domain-driven requirements.

## Decision
Adopt Clean Architecture as the primary pattern for all new business logic. Separate code into Domain, Data, Application, and Presentation layers.

## Consequences
+ Clear separation of concerns
+ Easier testing and onboarding
- Slightly more boilerplate and initial setup

## Alternatives Considered
- MVC: Simpler, but less scalable and harder to test
- Feature-based folders: Good for small apps, but can become messy as complexity grows
```

## When to Write an ADR

- When making a significant architectural or technical decision
- When choosing between competing patterns or libraries
- When introducing or deprecating a major dependency
- When changing the structure of the codebase
