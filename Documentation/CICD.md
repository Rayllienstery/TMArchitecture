# CI/CD Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides universal best practices and recommendations for implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in any technology stack.

---

## Goals of CI/CD

- Automate build, test, and deployment processes
- Ensure fast, reliable feedback for every code change
- Reduce manual errors and increase release confidence
- Enable frequent, predictable, and safe releases

---

## Key Stages of a CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Source Control Integration**
   - Trigger pipeline on every commit, pull/merge request, or tag
   - Enforce code review and branch protection rules

2. **Build**
   - Compile/assemble code, resolve dependencies
   - Fail fast on build errors

3. **Static Analysis & Linting**
   - Run linters, static code analyzers, security scanners
   - Enforce code style and quality gates

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Run unit, integration, UI, and E2E tests
   - Collect and publish test and coverage reports
   - Fail pipeline on test or coverage failures

5. **Artifact Management**
   - Package build artifacts (binaries, containers, archives)
   - Store artifacts in a registry or repository

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging, QA, or production environments
   - Use blue/green, canary, or rolling deployment strategies
   - Automate rollback on failure

7. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Run smoke tests, health checks, and monitoring
   - Alert on failures or regressions

8. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Integrate with monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
   - Collect metrics on build, test, and deployment performance

## Best Practices

- Keep pipelines fast and deterministic (fail fast, parallelize where possible)
- Use infrastructure-as-code for reproducible environments
- Store pipeline configuration as code (YAML, scripts, etc.) in version control
- Secure secrets and credentials (use vaults, environment variables, never hardcode)
- Automate rollbacks and recovery procedures
- Tag and version all releases
- Document pipeline steps and requirements
- Regularly review and update pipeline configuration
- Integrate security and compliance checks early (shift left)
- Use feature flags for safe releases
- Monitor pipeline health and flakiness

---

## Feature Flags & Canary Releases

- Use feature flags to enable safe, incremental rollouts and quick rollback of new features.
- Implement canary and blue/green deployments to reduce risk during releases.
- Consider progressive delivery tools for advanced rollout strategies.

---

## Secrets Management

- Store secrets securely using dedicated tools
- Use built-in secrets management in CI/CD platforms
- Never hardcode secrets in code or pipeline configs
- Rotate secrets regularly and audit access

---

## Release Notes & Changelog Automation

- Automate generation of release notes and changelogs
- Integrate changelog generation into the CI/CD pipeline for every release
- Ensure release documentation is accessible and up-to-date for all stakeholders

---

## Security in CI/CD

- Scan dependencies and containers for vulnerabilities
- Enforce least privilege for pipeline agents and service accounts
- Audit pipeline logs and access
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Block deployments on critical security issues

---

## Rollback and Recovery

- Automate rollback on failed deployment or health check
- Keep previous stable artifacts available for quick restore
- Document rollback procedures and test them regularly

---

## Documentation and Metrics

- Document pipeline structure, triggers, and requirements
- Track metrics: build time, test pass rate, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Use dashboards for visibility
