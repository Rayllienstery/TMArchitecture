# Project Overview

This project is a scalable, maintainable application architecture template built with Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It emphasizes code quality, automation, and best practices for modern software development.

> This architecture template combines Clean Architecture principles with practical implementation patterns. While inspired by Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture, it includes adaptations based on real-world experience to better suit modern development needs.
>
> Note: This documentation was created with AI assistance for formatting and clarity.

Before implementing architectural patterns such as MVVM, Clean Architecture, or VIPER, consider these key principles:

- Architecture serves as a means to achieve maintainable and scalable code, not an end in itself
- Architectural decisions should align with project needs and team capabilities
- Premature implementation of complex patterns can introduce unnecessary overhead
- Consider adopting more structured architecture when code maintenance, testing, or extension becomes challenging
- This architecture represents one approach among many valid options, shaped by practical experience and project requirements
- Architecture should be flexible enough to be implemented incrementally as the team and project grow

It's better to have simple, working code than a complicated system that slows down the team.

## Architecture

- **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation of Presentation, Domain, Data, and (optional) Application layers.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business logic is isolated in the Domain layer, with clear boundaries and responsibilities.
- **SwiftUI Best Practices**: Modern state management, accessibility, localization, and modular UI components.
- **Automation**: CI/CD, code quality tools, and automated testing are integrated throughout the workflow.

## Getting Started

1. **Quick Start**
   - Read the [Quick Start Guide](/iOS_Implementation/QuickStart/QUICK_START.md) for a minimal implementation example
   - Follow the step-by-step guide to create your first feature

2. **Basic Setup**
   - Review the [Architecture Overview](Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - Understand the [Layer Responsibilities](Documentation/LAYER_RESPONSIBILITIES.md)
   - Set up your development environment

3. **First Feature**
   - Create a simple feature following the architecture
   - Implement basic CRUD operations
   - Add unit tests

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

   - Read and understand the architecture principles
   - Review existing issues and discussions

2. **Development Process**
   - Create a new branch for your feature
   - Follow the established code style
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Pull Request Process**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues
