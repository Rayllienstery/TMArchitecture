# Security and Privacy Guidelines

This document outlines the security and privacy requirements, best practices, and implementation guidelines for this iOS application. It is designed to ensure compliance with industry standards, Apple App Store requirements, and data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum permissions required for each component and user.
- **Defense in Depth:** Apply multiple layers of security (app, OS, network, backend).
- **Secure by Design:** Integrate security from the earliest stages of development.
- **Privacy by Design:** Minimize data collection, use, and retention. Always prefer anonymization and aggregation.
- **Transparency:** Clearly inform users about data collection, usage, and sharing.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.

## 2. Data Protection & Privacy

### 2.1. Sensitive Data Management

- Never store sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in plain text.
- Use Keychain for credentials, tokens, and secrets.
- Use iOS Secure Enclave for biometric and cryptographic operations.
- Avoid storing sensitive data in UserDefaults or local files.
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### 2.2. Data Minimization

- Collect only data strictly necessary for app functionality.
- Regularly review and remove unused data fields and permissions.

### 2.3. Data Retention and Deletion

- Define clear data retention policies.
- Provide users with the ability to delete their data (right to be forgotten).
- Securely erase data when no longer needed.

## 3. Security Implementation

### 3.1. Network Security

- Use HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) for all network communications.
- Validate SSL/TLS certificates (enable App Transport Security, ATS).
- Implement certificate pinning for critical endpoints.
- Never log sensitive data in network requests or responses.
- Use secure, authenticated APIs (OAuth2, JWT, etc.).
- Handle network errors and timeouts gracefully.

### 3.2. Authentication & Authorization

- Use Sign in with Apple or OAuth2 for user authentication where possible.
- Store authentication tokens securely in Keychain.
- Implement session expiration and token refresh.
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) in the backend and, where relevant, in the app.
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials in the codebase.

### 3.3. Secure Coding

- Validate and sanitize all user input (prevent XSS, injection, etc.).
- Avoid force unwrapping and force try in Swift code.
- Use strong typing and optionals to prevent null pointer exceptions.
- Handle errors and exceptions securely (no sensitive info in error messages).
- Use dependency injection to avoid tight coupling and facilitate testing.
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities (CVE, Snyk, etc.).

- Use static analysis tools (SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, Xcode Analyzer) to catch security issues early.

## 4. Privacy & Compliance

### 4.1. User Consent & Privacy Policy

- Display a clear privacy policy in the app and on the App Store.
- Request user consent before accessing sensitive data (location, camera, contacts, etc.).
- Use the minimum required scope for permissions (e.g., NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription).
- Allow users to opt out of analytics and tracking.
- Use Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework if tracking is present.
- Support user data export and deletion requests.

### 4.2. Regulatory Compliance

- Focus on GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.
- Include App Store compliance requirements.

## 5. Development & Operations

### 5.1. CI/CD & DevSecOps

- Automate security checks in CI/CD (static analysis, dependency scanning).
- Use code review checklists for security and privacy.
- Store secrets and credentials in secure CI/CD vaults (never in code or repo).
- Run regular security audits and penetration tests.
- Enforce branch protection and code review policies.

### 5.2. Logging & Monitoring

- Do not log sensitive data (PII, credentials, tokens).
- Use OSLog with appropriate privacy levels for logging.
- Monitor for unusual activity, crashes, and security events.
- Integrate with crash reporting and analytics tools (e.g., Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics) with privacy in mind.

### 5.3. Incident Response

- Define a process for reporting and responding to security incidents.
- Document contact information for responsible security personnel.
- Maintain a changelog of security-related updates and patches.

## 6. Threat Modeling

Understanding and documenting **trust boundaries** is essential for securing each architectural level. This includes:

### 6.1. Context Level (System Overview)

- Define external actors (users, APIs, third-party SDKs).
- Document trusted/untrusted interfaces (e.g., public API, analytics SDKs, auth providers).
- Identify primary data flows (e.g., login, data sync, push).

### 6.2. Container Level (App & Services)

- Mark the app as a trusted container, with boundaries between:
  - UI ↔ Business Logic
  - App ↔ Network APIs
- Use HTTPS and App Transport Security (ATS) to protect container communication.

### 6.3. Component Level (Modules & Libraries)

- Identify internal modules that require isolation (e.g., storage, auth, crypto).
- Use dependency injection to control access to sensitive services.
- Avoid direct SDK access in UI code.

### 6.4. Code Level (Class & Function)

- Avoid leaking sensitive data across boundaries (e.g., logging passwords in view models).
- Annotate sensitive areas with comments and restrict scope.

---

**Summary:**

- Use environment variables for build-time secrets.
- Use Keychain/Secure Enclave for runtime secrets.
- Never commit secrets to version control.

## 9. How to Use Environment Variables for Secrets in iOS

Storing secrets (API keys, credentials) in environment variables is a secure and recommended practice. Here's how to do it for iOS projects:

### 9.1. Xcode (Local Development)

1. **Add Environment Variable to Scheme:**
   - Xcode → Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments → Environment Variables.
   - Add: `API_KEY = your-secret-key-here`
2. **Access in Swift:**

   ```swift
   if let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["API_KEY"] {
       // Use apiKey
   }
   ```

### 9.2. .xcconfig Files (Do NOT commit secrets)

1. Create a file (e.g., `Secrets.xcconfig`) and add:

   ``` text
   API_KEY = your-secret-key-here
   ```

2. Reference this file in your target's build settings (Base Configuration).
3. Access via Info.plist or custom build script, but never commit secrets to git.

### 9.3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, GitLab CI, etc.)

1. **Add secret in CI/CD settings** (e.g., `API_KEY`).
2. **Pass to build:**
   - **GitHub Actions:**

     ```yaml
     - name: Build app
       run: xcodebuild -scheme MyApp
       env:
         API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
     ```

   - **Bitrise:** Add secret in Workflow Editor; it will be available as an environment variable.
3. **Access in Swift:**

   ```swift
   let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["API_KEY"]
   ```

### 9.4. Secure Enclave & Keychain

- For runtime secrets (tokens, credentials), use Keychain or Secure Enclave APIs.

### 9.5. Never Store Secrets in Code or Info.plist

- Do not hardcode secrets in Swift files, Info.plist, or UserDefaults.
